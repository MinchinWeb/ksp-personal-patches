// kOS includes a lagecy 0m part. The model was broken, but the lagecy version
// was included (and supposed to be hidden) to not break savegames.
// See https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues/1425 and
//     https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/pull/1494
//
// Both are showing up in my game, so this removes the legacy part.
