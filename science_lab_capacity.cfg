	// @description = No longer are you limited to research facilities only on Kerbin!  With the Mobile Processing Lab, you can conduct long-term experiments and ongoing research with the data you collect in the field.  Be sure to check back on your scientists from time to time, and transmit the results of their research home! This model is guaranteed to spontaneously combust less than previous models, and also has the equipment necessary to clean out and restore functionality to inoperable experiments. 
    @description ^= :(.)$:$0 Note: It was recently discovered that the assembly instructions are double sided. That explains all the extra parts we had previously, this Lab can now seat six.
