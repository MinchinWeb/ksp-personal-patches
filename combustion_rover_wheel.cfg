// Author: KerbMav
//
// It always bugged me that rover wheels were so high up (right) in the tech
// tree.
//
// For Kerbin surface exploration around the KSC there should be a good old
// combustion engine, so I kind of made one.
//
// The LqFuel+Air(Oxygen) powered wheel becomes available with aviation, just
// in time for the needed air intakes - as well as in the same tech node most
// players will start building jet cars on landing gears, so quite fitting I
// think.
//
// Comes with a paragraph to integrate WheelSounds, not really part of a stock
// patch, feel free to just toss it out.
